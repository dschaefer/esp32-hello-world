This is the esp-idf hello world example done using the latest CDT and in a style I'll be doing ESP32 projects.

It hooks up the esp-idf SDK using a git submodule.
This lets you establish a firm relationship between your project and a fixed version of the SDK.

This project also uses the latest CDT, in particular it's new support for Makefile projects with the
Core Build build system.
